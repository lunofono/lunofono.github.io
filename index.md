Hi, this is a preliminary website for *Lunofono*, the media player for kids.

Lunofono is in preview state for now, and this web is mostly only a placeholder
for the [privacy policy](legal/privacy), required by Google Play.

I will probably add more content when things get more mature.

If you want to support my work, so I can spend more time developing Lunofono,
I offer several [supporting
platforms](https://github.com/llucax/llucax/blob/main/sponsoring-platforms.md)
(in order of preference):
