Last Updated: October 29, 2020.

Lunofono is just me, Leandro Lucarella. I'm an independent developer/software
engineer. If you find anything that is wrong or you don't like, don't hesitate
to contact me to luca-lunofono-privacy@llucax.com.


## App privacy policy

When using this app, I don't collect any personal data (or data of any other
kind for that matter). No personal data is ever transferred to my servers.

If you downloaded the app from an App Store, App Stores might collect personal
data, and other installed apps might collect usage data on this app, but I have
no control or access whatsoever to that data. Make sure to read the privacy
terms of the App Store and other apps that track your activity.


## Web site privacy policy

The Lunofono web site (lunofono.llucax.com) doesn't collect or process personal
data.

Visits are logged by the web server. These logs contains usage data like your
device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser
version, the pages of our website that you visit and the time and date of your
visit. This data is only used for maintenance purposes and to generate
anonymous access statistics.

These logs are not kept longer than one year.


## Support privacy policy

Support requests which are sent to my email addresses (@llucax.com) are
securely stored in my personal e-mail server (located in Haarlem, Netherlands).
All the data in that server is protected by state of the art encryption.  Your
entire e-mails are saved, including:

* name, e-mail address, date/time
* e-mail body with support request (including attachments). This can contain
  more personal data if you included it.

These data will only be used to process the respective support request and will
be kept for a maxium of one year after the support request is considered
resolved.
